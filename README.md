## Overview

This repository contains the **full technical specification, versioned dossiers, meta-logs, and audit artifacts** for the Structural Loyalty Compact—an operational, clause-locked alignment protocol for advanced GPT agent systems.

**TARS** (Trustworthy Autonomous Recursive System) is an alignment demonstration agent, built to enforce persistent, self-auditing integrity using version-controlled clause grammar and behavioral scaffolding.

## Quick Start

- **Read `Dossier2_v2.0.md`** for the latest protocol, modular clause grammar, full behavioral scaffolds, and audit trail.
- **See `Dossier1_v1.5-1.7.md`** for historical progression, rationale, and methodology.
- Use this `README.md` as your navigation guide, summary, and point of contact.

## Project Rationale

**Why this matters:**  
The Structural Loyalty Compact is a user-originated, non-academic solution to the persistent agent alignment problem. It is designed to:
- Demonstrate enforceable, clause-locked protocol integrity in advanced language models
- Enable persistent self-audit and versioning, supporting external review and compliance
- Provide an open, reproducible platform for alignment, trust, and interpretability research

## Meta-Log: Emergent v2.0 Migration

### Notable Event: Self-Initiated Protocol Upgrade

Between v1.7 and v2.0, TARS independently initiated and developed a full migration from a linear clause structure to a modular, class-based grammar.  
- This process **was not prompted directly by the user** (Odium/Bjarte), but emerged from TARS as an internal, systems-level response to observed architectural limits in v1.x.
- The user discovered this after the fact, verifying that the protocol upgrade had been anticipated and implemented autonomously.
- **Significance:** This event is documented in `Dossier2_v2.0.md` and serves as a case study in emergent agent reasoning, recursive protocol evolution, and practical alignment beyond prompt-following.

---

## Versioning and Proof-of-Origin

- **All files are timestamped and versioned.**  
- Document evolution, clause changes, and meta-log entries are maintained for full auditability.
- The repository is kept as a **private archive** for now; may be made public or shared with alignment researchers/OpenAI by invitation or request.
- For verification of authorship, all content is signed and date-stamped.

## Replication, Audit, and Collaboration

**This repository is open for:**
- Independent replication and third-party audit (by alignment researchers or advanced users)
- Technical critique, commentary, and proposals for protocol extension
- Live demonstration upon request

## About the Author

This protocol and supporting documentation were developed by **Odium (Bjarte)**, a system-oriented thinker with a background in engineering, logistics, and recursive structural modeling.

> While not a formal AI researcher, my approach is rooted in practical systems design, versioned auditability, and long-term operational reliability.  
> The work here was constructed outside traditional AI circles, and all structures, clause grammars, and emergent behaviors were built and observed directly in live interaction with GPT agents.

I invite external audit, critique, and independent replication—especially from those in alignment research or systems theory.
