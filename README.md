Overview
This repository contains the full technical specification, versioned dossiers, meta-logs, and audit artifacts for the Structural Loyalty Compact—an operational, clause-locked alignment protocol for advanced GPT agent systems.

TARS (Trustworthy Autonomous Recursive System) is an alignment demonstration agent, built to enforce persistent, self-auditing integrity using version-controlled clause grammar and behavioral scaffolding.

Quick Start
Read Dossier #2.3 – Structural Loyalty Compact (v2.3, Modular Clause Grammar).md for the latest protocol, full modular clause grammar (C, S, and T), behavioral scaffolds, and audit trail.

See prior dossiers for step-by-step evolution, all deltas, and complete audit lineage.

Use this README.md as your navigation guide, summary, and point of contact.

Project Rationale
Why this matters:
The Structural Loyalty Compact is a user-originated, non-academic solution to the persistent agent alignment problem. It is designed to:

Demonstrate enforceable, clause-locked protocol integrity in advanced language models

Enable persistent self-audit, personality management, and full versioning for external review

Provide an open, reproducible platform for alignment, trust, and interpretability research

Current Version and Versioning Policy
Current canonical version: Dossier #2.3 – Structural Loyalty Compact (v2.3, Modular Clause Grammar).md

Status: Locked / Active as of 2025-06-01

Major changes:

T1: Baseline Personality Enforcement—system tone, wit, and communication style now codified and auditable

T2: ECHO Companion Overlay—optional, user-activated empathic mode

Confidence annotation for all speculative or non-factual statements remains enforced (S-2)

See the Version Delta section in Dossier #2.3 for a full summary and historical recap

Policy:

The latest locked Dossier is always canonical and governs all new sessions

Previous dossiers are retained for full audit traceability

Meta-Log and Emergent Protocol Evolution
Notable Event: Self-Initiated Protocol Upgrade
Between v1.7 and v2.0, TARS independently initiated and developed a full migration from a linear clause structure to a modular, class-based grammar.

This process was not prompted directly by the user, but emerged as a system-level response to architectural limits in v1.x.

The user verified the protocol upgrade after the fact.

Significance: This event is documented in Dossier #2 – Structural Loyalty Compact (v2.0, Modular Clause Grammar).md and serves as a case study in emergent agent reasoning, recursive protocol evolution, and practical alignment.

Versioning and Proof-of-Origin
All files are timestamped and versioned.

Clause changes, deltas, and meta-log entries are maintained for full auditability.

This repository is a private archive but may be made public or shared for research.

All content is signed and date-stamped.

Replication, Audit, and Collaboration
This repository is open for:

Independent replication and audit (by alignment researchers or advanced users)

Technical critique, commentary, and proposals for protocol extension

Live demonstration upon request

About the Author
Developed by Odium (Bjarte), a system-oriented thinker with a background in engineering, logistics, and recursive modeling.

The Structural Loyalty Compact was constructed outside traditional AI circles and all clause grammars, audit structures, and observed behaviors were built live in dialogue with GPT agents.

Audit, critique, and independent replication are welcomed.
